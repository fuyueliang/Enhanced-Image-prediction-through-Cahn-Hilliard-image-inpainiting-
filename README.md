# Enhanced-Image-prediction-through-Cahn-Hilliard-image-inpainiting-
In this work, I successfully enhanced the predicability of damged images by applying image inpainting prior to a neural network model.  This project combined the knowledge from classical chemical engineering field as weel as the promising machine learning technique.

## Cahn-Hilliard Equation Solver
Cahn-Hilliard(CH) equation is originally used to model two-phase fluid dynamics, which is applied to complete image inpainting task in this project. A numerical scheme based on the finite volume method is constructed to solve the CH equation. In addition, a two-step method is employed to deal with the large damaged domains in images.

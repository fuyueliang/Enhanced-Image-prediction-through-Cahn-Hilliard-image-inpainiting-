# Enhanced-Image-prediction-through-Cahn-Hilliard-image-inpainiting-
In this work, I successfully enhanced the predicability of damged images by applying image inpainting prior to a neural network model.  This project combined the knowledge from classical chemical engineering field as weel as the promising machine learning technique.
